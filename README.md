# YouTube - Mouseover Preview
Uses YouTube's storyboard to show preview images when hovering a video's thumbnail. Hold shift while clicking to jump to the time shown in the preview image.

## Installation
You need to have a UserScript extension (e.g. Tampermonkey for Chrome, Greasemonkey for Firefox) installed to run this script.

[Install this UserScript](https://github.com/LenAnderson/YouTube-Mouseover-Preview/raw/master/youtube_mouseover_preview.user.js)


## Compatibility with other scripts
Works with [View More Videos by Same YouTube Channel](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/370637-view-more-videos-by-same-youtube-channel) script. SHIFT+click to jump to the previewed part of the video does not work for the video links added by that script since it does not offer the video's duration.


## Credits
These two scripts really helped me find my way around YouTube's storyboard feature:
