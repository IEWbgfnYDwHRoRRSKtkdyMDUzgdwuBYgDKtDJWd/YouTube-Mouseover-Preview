# YouTube - Mouseover Preview
Uses YouTube's storyboard to show preview images when hovering a video's thumbnail.

## Installation
You need to have a UserScript extension (e.g. Tampermonkey for Chrome, Greasemonkey for Firefox) installed to run this script.

[Install this UserScript](https://github.com/LenAnderson/YouTube-Mouseover-Preview/raw/master/youtube_mouseover_preview.user.js)


## Known Issues
- Currently only the really small storyboard images (80x45px) can be shown. As a result the (resized) images are a bit blurry.


## Credits
These two scripts really helped me find my way around YouTube's storyboard feature:
